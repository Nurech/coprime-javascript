Let m, n be integers. We say that m and n are coprime numbers (or relatively prime) if there
exists no integer larger than 1 which divides both n and m. Example: 4 and 9 are coprime, 13
and 91 are not (91 is divisible by 13).
Prove that if you choose 31 integers from the range of number within [1, 2, 3 . . . , 60], that at least two
numbers must be coprime
